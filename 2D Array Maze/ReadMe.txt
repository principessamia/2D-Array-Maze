- TDD code implementation to explore 2-D array representing a maze 
- The maze grid is N x N (square) or M x N (rectangular).  That is, all rows are of equal length and all columns are of equal length
- The edge of the maze is surrounded by walls on all sides, valid openings are only for start and finish points
- The report of where an explorer has been keeps a complete record of all moves, even in the event of backtracking, these duplicate moves are captured
- No diagonal moves!
